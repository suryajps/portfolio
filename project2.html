                The project explores the demands on a window, and the total potential there-in for it to do and be more, both environmentally and culturally. My research explores how windows affect sleep quality through two often-overlooked factors: ambient light at night and environmental noise. Rather than evaluating windows solely for thermal performance or views, the project centers on occupant wellbeing and circadian health.

            <p class="project-description">
                The investigation combined spatial analysis with environmental monitoring to understand the window's role as a mediator between exterior conditions and interior comfort. Ray tracing identified external light sources like street lamps and traffic signals, while RGB imaging photometry captured how nighttime light actually affects human photoreceptors. Light sensors tracked exposure patterns from the window sill to bedside, documenting how early morning daylight enters the space.
Acoustic measurements compared sound levels with the window open and closed across different times of day. Spectral frequency analysis revealed not just decibel levels, but the character of noise from idling vehicles to accelerating traffic that penetrates the interior.
The study reveals windows as critical regulators of health, managing the light and sound that shape our daily rhythms and sleep quality.
