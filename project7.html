                    This study quantifies the carbon impacts of fundamental structural decisions for a university campus building. The challenge was determining whether structural system substitution alone could significantly reduce embodied carbon, and by how much.<br>
                    <strong><em>Approach: </em></strong>Three structural systems were modeled and compared across both mass and global warming potential: all-timber construction, hybrid timber-concrete-steel, and conventional steel frame. Life cycle assessment methodology tracked embodied carbon across material extraction, manufacturing, transportation, and construction phases.<br>
                    The analysis revealed timber framing alone reduced global warming potential by 86% compared to the steel baseline. The hybrid system achieved a 51% reduction, demonstrating that material selection in the structural systems could drastically reduce embodied carbon.<br>
                    <strong><em>Key Findings: </em></strong>The study then traced pathways from a campus baseline of 800 kgCO2/m2 down to 170 kgCO2/m2 over a 60-year lifecycle. Building reuse eliminated new structural carbon. Timber framing provided the steepest single reduction. Envelope and interior strategies—bio-based insulation, reduced replacement rates, low-carbon procurement—contributed incremental but meaningful savings. The research demonstrated that achieving deep carbon reductions requires coordinated interventions across structure, envelope, interiors, and operations, not isolated material swaps.

                    This research investigates: can adding trees to buildings increase carbon emissions? As "vertical forests" proliferate in architectural culture, this study examined whether intensive balcony planting creates environmental benefits or simply adds to the carbon-intensive construction.<br>
                    <strong><em>Approach: </em></strong>Four hypothetical scenarios were developed for a 20-story building. Each scenario was evaluated for embodied carbon, operational carbon, and carbon storage over 30 years. The vertical forest configuration required additional structural capacity due to  additional live loads, irrigation systems, and intensive planting media. The analysis tracked whether operational savings from shading could offset the embodied carbon penalty.<br>
                    <strong><em>Key Findings: </em></strong>Planting on balconies increased embodied carbon by 30-50% due to structural reinforcement and planting infrastructure. However, total carbon over 30 years remained comparable to the baseline because operational savings from passive cooling were considerable. The stored carbon from plants was negligible compared to building-scale emissions. The research revealed that vertical forests aren't inherently sustainable, their carbon footprint depends entirely on whether operational benefits justify the embodied carbon investment, a calculation that varies dramatically by climate, building type, and maintenance regime.
