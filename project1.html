                The storage "clouds" beneath endless scrolling on Instagram, streaming on Netflix, and computing ChatGPT queries has a physical presence. Thousands of giant, windowless, featureless boxes scattered across the world, are contributing significantly to the warming planet. The 21st century digital era relies on enormous data centers consuming vast amounts of energy and water, and projected to emit 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. How can we ensure that the digital preeminence has minimal environmental impacts? Can local climates be used to our advantage to power these energy hogs?

                Phoenix experiences a hot and dry climate, meaning the range between dry bulb and dew point temperature is wide enough to incorporate evaporative cooling. The project investigates effects of solar radiation and night flushing on shaping the building geometry. The design evolves from a cone-shaped geometry inspired by traditional case studies, then aggregates the geometries in various sizes and orientation to minimize solar heat gain on the building envelope. The geometry is further optimized for maximizing exposure to the night sky for night-cooling potential. Materiality is driven by locality, circularity, and physical properties such as thermal mass and conductivity.
