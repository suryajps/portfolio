                    This project traces the movement of lead through urban ecosystems, revealing how industrial legacies persist in Philadelphia's Kensington neighborhood. Powers Park, once adjacent to the Anzon lead-smelting complex, became a community green space decades after the industry closed, yet the contamination remained embedded in the soil.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    Using systems diagramming, the study maps lead's journey across multiple environmental layers and timescales. The visualization identifies four primary contamination sources: the historic Leipers Quarry in Swarthmore (lead-uranium compounds), the former smelting plant, leaded gasoline deposited from traffic, and weathered lead paint from aging buildings. The diagram follows lead as it moves, sticks, and changes form through interconnected flows. In soil, lead particles settle indefinitely as heavy metals measured in micrograms. Wind lifts contaminated dust from chipped paint. Rain infiltrates soil, carrying lead into groundwater. Children playing in the park face exposure through ingestion and inhalation, risking neurological damage.

                <p class="project-description">
                    Beyond human health, the research examines lead's disruption of natural cycles. It inhibits soil microbes responsible for denitrification, producing unwanted nitrous oxide and triggering eutrophication in the Delaware River. It inactivates enzymes in the phosphorus cycle, altering nutrient availability for plants. In vegetation, lead damages root systems, disrupts stomatal function, and reduces photosynthesis. The project demonstrates how environmental justice issues are grounded in landscape, where industrial history, material flows, and community health intersect.

                <h1>Flooring Materials Health Assessment</h1>
                <div class="project-meta">
                    <span>Year: 2024</span>

                <p class="project-description">
                    This research addresses a straightforward but critical question: What flooring products should KieranTimberlake recommend when material health is a primary concern? The study evaluates resilient flooring options not just for performance and aesthetics, but for their impacts on factory workers, building occupants, communities, and climate throughout their lifecycle.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    Seven flooring materials were assessed across five criteria: durability, installation and maintenance requirements, colors and finishes, material health impacts, and first cost. The material health analysis examined chemicals of concern at two critical stages. Occupational exposure tracks vinyl chloride monomers, isocyanates, and heavy metals affecting workers during manufacturing. Occupant exposure evaluates phthalates, volatile organic compounds, and off-gassing that impact building users. Each material was rated for its effects on climate health, occupant wellbeing, and health equity, recognizing that environmental burdens often fall disproportionately on vulnerable communities.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    The findings reveal stark contrasts. Linoleum emerged as the strongest natural material option across all criteria, while luxury vinyl tile ranked worst for material health. Comprehensive supply chain investigations exposed how PVC manufacturing involves toxic emissions, forced labor issues, environmental justice concerns, and ecological degradation at every lifecycle phase from production through disposal. The research provides architects with evidence-based guidance for client advocacy, demonstrating that material selection is fundamentally a health and equity decision, not merely an aesthetic or cost consideration.
