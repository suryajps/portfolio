                This project traces the movement of lead through urban ecosystems, revealing how industrial legacies persist in Philadelphia's Kensington neighborhood. Powers Park, once adjacent to the Anzon lead-smelting complex, became a community green space decades after the industry closed, yet the contamination remained embedded in the soil. Using systems diagramming, the study maps lead's journey across multiple environmental layers and timescales. The visualization identifies four primary contamination sources: the historic Leipers Quarry in Swarthmore (lead-uranium compounds), the former smelting plant, leaded gasoline deposited from traffic, and weathered lead paint from aging buildings.
The diagram follows lead as it moves, sticks, and changes form through interconnected flows. In soil, lead particles settle indefinitely as heavy metals measured in micrograms. Wind lifts contaminated dust from chipped paint. Rain infiltrates soil, carrying lead into groundwater. Children playing in the park face exposure through ingestion and inhalation, risking neurological damage.

                Beyond human health, the research examines lead's disruption of natural cycles. It inhibits soil microbes responsible for denitrification, producing unwanted nitrous oxide and triggering eutrophication in the Delaware River. It inactivates enzymes in the phosphorus cycle, altering nutrient availability for plants. In vegetation, lead damages root systems, disrupts stomatal function, and reduces photosynthesis. The project demonstrates how environmental justice issues are grounded in landscape, where industrial history, material flows, and community health intersect.
