                    The project traces the movement of lead through urban ecosystems, revealing how industrial legacies persist in Philadelphia's Kensington neighborhood. Powers Park, once adjacent to the Anzon lead-smelting complex, became a community green space decades after the industry closed, yet the contamination remains embedded in the soil.<br><br>
                    Using systems diagramming, the study maps lead's journey across multiple environmental layers and timescales. The visualization identifies four primary contamination sources: the historic Leipers Quarry in Swarthmore (lead-uranium compounds), the former smelting plant, leaded gasoline deposited from traffic, and weathered lead paint from aging buildings.<br><br>
                    Human health impacts of lead are still prevalent after five decades of banning its use. Children playing in the park still face exposure through ingestion and inhalation, risking neurological damage. The project demonstrates how environmental justice issues are grounded in landscapes, where industrial history, material flows, and community health intersect.

                    This research addresses what flooring materials can projects recommend when durability, cost and material health is a concern. The material health analysis examined chemicals of concern at two critical stages. Occupational exposure tracks vinyl chloride monomers, isocyanates, and heavy metals affecting workers during manufacturing. Occupant exposure evaluates phthalates, volatile organic compounds, and off-gassing that impact building users. Each material was rated for its effects on climate health, occupant wellbeing, and health equity, recognizing that environmental burdens often fall disproportionately on vulnerable communities.<br><br>
                    Linoleum emerged as the strongest natural material option across all criteria, while luxury vinyl tile ranked worst for material health. Comprehensive supply chain investigations exposed how PVC manufacturing involves toxic emissions, forced labor issues, environmental justice concerns, and ecological degradation at every lifecycle phase from production through disposal. The research provides architects with evidence-based guidance for client advocacy, demonstrating that material selection is fundamentally a health and equity decision, not merely an aesthetic or cost consideration.
